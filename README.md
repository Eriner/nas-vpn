# NAS-VPN

This is where I will place instructions for accessing the NAS VPN to connect to NAS in the event that your tyrannical Government blocks Internet access to the site.

This IS NOT a general VPN. While you will be able to access NAS directly using this VPN, it will not enable you to access other sites over the VPN.

You WILL be able to access other non-censored websites on the Internet simultaneously while using the VPN to access NAS, but traffic sent to those other sites will NOT traverse the NAS VPN.
